# n-ide.nvim

This is my Neovim configuration for using it as an IDE. It’s forked from kickstart.nvim. Feel free to use it however you like, but I strongly recommend checking out the kickstart.nvim repository to build your own setup, it’s very easy to get started and understand.

## Installation

### Install Neovim

This was built to be used on an Arch-based distro. I have no intention of porting it to other operating systems. If you are using a different environment, I highly recommend checking out the kickstart.nvim repository, they support Windows, macOS, and other Linux distributions.
(It will probably work on any popular modern distro as long as you meet the requirements listed below.)

### Install External Dependencies

External Requirements:
- Basic utils: `git`, `make`, `unzip`, C Compiler (`gcc`)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation),
  [fd-find](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd#installation)
- Clipboard tool (xclip/xsel/win32yank or other depending on the platform)
- A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/): optional, this can be turned off easily 
- Language Setup:
  - If you want to write Typescript, you need `npm`
  - If you want to write Golang, you will need `go`
  - etc.

#### Arch Requeriments

```
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm --needed gcc make git ripgrep fd unzip neovim
```

### Install Kickstart

> [!NOTE]
> [Backup](#FAQ) your previous configuration (if any exists)

#### Clone kickstart.nvim

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim
```
### Post Installation

Start Neovim

```sh
nvim
```

That's it! Lazy will install all the plugins you have. Use `:Lazy` to view
the current plugin status. Hit `q` to close the window.

### FAQ

* What should I do if I already have a pre-existing Neovim configuration?
  * You should back it up and then delete all associated files.
  * This includes your existing init.lua and the Neovim files in `~/.local`
    which can be deleted with `rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim/`
* Can I keep my existing configuration in parallel to kickstart?
  * Yes! You can use [NVIM_APPNAME](https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#%24NVIM_APPNAME)`=nvim-NAME`
    to maintain multiple configurations. For example, you can install the kickstart
    configuration in `~/.config/nvim-kickstart` and create an alias:
    ```
    alias nvim-kickstart='NVIM_APPNAME="nvim-kickstart" nvim'
    ```
    When you run Neovim using `nvim-kickstart` alias it will use the alternative
    config directory and the matching local directory
    `~/.local/share/nvim-kickstart`. You can apply this approach to any Neovim
    distribution that you would like to try out.
* What if I want to "uninstall" this configuration:
  * See [lazy.nvim uninstall](https://lazy.folke.io/usage#-uninstalling) information
